## üéÆ Usage

### For Users

1. Use `/verify` command in the designated verification channel
2. Upload a screenshot as proof
3. Provide your character name and guild name
4. Wait for admin approval
5. **Note**: Any non-command messages in the verification channel will be automatically deleted and you'll receive a private DM with guidance

### For Admins

1. Monitor verification requests in the designated channel
2. Click "Approve Verification" button to approve users or "Deny Verification" to deny with reason
3. When denying, provide a mandatory reason in the popup modal
4. Check logs in the log channel or `verification_bot_logs.txt` file
5. Monitor auto-moderation events in the log channel

**Note**: Denied users must resubmit their verification before they can be approved.

## ü§ñ Auto-Moderation Features

### Message Guidance System

- **Trigger**: When users send any message that isn't `/verify` in the verification channel
- **Response**: Bot sends a private DM with guidance to use `/verify` command
- **Fallback**: If DM fails (user has DMs disabled), sends a public reply
- **Auto-Delete**: Original message is automatically deleted to keep channel clean

### Auto-Moderation Features

#### Message Guidance System

- **Trigger**: When users send any message that isn't `/verify` in the verification channel
- **Response**: Bot sends a private DM with guidance to use `/verify` command
- **Fallback**: If DM fails (user has DMs disabled), sends a public reply
- **Auto-Delete**: Original message is automatically deleted to keep channel clean

#### Example Auto-Moderation Flow

1. User types: "How do I get verified?"
2. Bot sends private DM: "Please use the /verify command to begin the verification process. Check out the instructions in #how-to-verify."
3. Bot deletes the original message
4. Channel stays clean and organized
